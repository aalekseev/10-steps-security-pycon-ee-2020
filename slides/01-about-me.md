<!-- note

Hello!

My name is Anton, I am a full-stack developer at Thorgate - a digital agency
focused on industry projects, as you know we value python community and organize
code club and pycon, open-sourcing some of the libraries. We build our projects
with a web framework that is build with python - called Django, and in this talk
most of the examples and tools are related to it.

I am not a security expert, just a regular software developer
who decided to invest time into learning about security.

If you like this talk and want to work with me,
we are always happy to onboard motivated professionals.
