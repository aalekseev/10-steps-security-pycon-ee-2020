<!-- note

Hello!

My name is Anton, I am a full-stack developer at Thorgate. We build our projects
with a Django web framework - it is build with python, and in this talk
most of the examples and tools are related to this framework.

A small disclamer - I am not a security expert, just a regular software developer
who decided to invest time into learning about security.
And if you want to discuss more about security, or just let me know
that this talk helped you to understand more about security you can contact me in Discord
or Twitter, or Facebook event page after the talk.
