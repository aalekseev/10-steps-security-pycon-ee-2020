Hello!

My name is Anton, I am a full-stack developer at Thorgate - a digital agency
focused on industry projects, as you know we value python community and organize
code club and pycon, open-sourcing some of the libraries.

I am not a security expert, just a regular software developer
who decided to invest time into learning about security.

If you like this talk and want to work with me,
we are always happy to on-board motivated professionals
