## STEP 0

Make security checks a reccuring activity

<!-- note

STEP ZERO

As simple as that. Make security checks you regular activity.
You can start slow with a small checklist and scheduled 1h each month.
I believe that this is something that any client would happily agree to do.

I have a few more slides if you want to learn more about security.
