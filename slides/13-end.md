## Teaser Pycon Estonia 2020

1. Use secure connection
2. Configure software with security in mind
3. Don't commit secrets to the repository
4. Check application dependencies
5. **Make it harder for attackers to guess about your application**
6. **Research and use the tools that already available**
7. **Use automatic tools to check your application**
8. **Don't trust user input and sanitize it**
9. **Protect user data by requesting only what necessary**
10. **Disallow everything, and gradually add permissions as they are required**

<!-- note

So, we covered 4 first steps to the more secure applications, but this is just a teaser
of what I will be talking on Pycon Estonia, that will happen on the next week.

I will cover the topics about
- what attackers can guess about your application
- which tools we can use to discover vulnerabilities in our applications
- how to protect sensitive data
and how dangerous can be broken access control
