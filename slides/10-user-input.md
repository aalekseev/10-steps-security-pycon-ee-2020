User input. We will start with two extreamly famous vulnerabilities that share one context related to the user input

<!-- sectionTitle: User Input -->

## 8. Don't trust user input and sanitize it

- [№1 in OWASP Top 10 - Injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection)
- [№4 in OWASP Top 10 - XML External Entities (XXE)](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A4-XML_External_Entities_(XXE))
- [№7 in OWASP Top 10 - Cross-Site Scripting XSS](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS))
- [№8 in OWASP Top 10 - Insecure Deserialization](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A8-Insecure_Deserialization)

### Not all users are nice.

<!-- note
User input can take many forms
- A comment form under the blog post
- A user profile image that user uploads themself
- An XML file that user to upload with some data

But what is common theme - is that not all users are nice,
and they will not do what they "suppose" to do with your application.

So - 2 most common attacks Cross-site scripting and SQL injection

import xssTweetdeck from '../assets/xss-tweetdeck.jpg'

## 8. Don't trust user input and sanitize it (XSS)

<img src={xssTweetdeck} className="slide-bottom content-center" />

<!-- note

So the story goes that there is a popular application Tweetdeck, that many people
and celebrities use to manage multiple twitter accounts.
And one day one smart person tried to post a tweet with javascript code inside.
And it worked. After that if you saw that tweet and hit
like or retweet you would be greet with an alert - hey there is a XSS vulnerability in Tweetdeck.
Luckily it was not a malicious user otherwise cosiquences would be far more dangerous.

In the essence cross site scripting related to unsanitized user input on the client side of the
application. Most of the time this attack is most powerful when the code that one user submitted
and it gets visible to other users.
Typical XSS attacks include session stealing, account takeower, key logging.

## 8. Don't trust user input and sanitize it (XSS prevention)

1. From Django 1.0 - template system by default escapes html code
1. Fromt Django 2.1 you can use `json_script` to add JSON safely into template
1. If you can, use markdown instead of raw HTML to provide users with reach text editor
1. But other than that - check your templates for user input and if it was marked as safe (in which case it is UNsafe)

<!-- note

Here are some of the things that you can do, to prevent the XSS attack in Django application.

And in the bottom I linked a super cool in-depth article by Anthony Shaw about XSS in Django
and btw he is an author of the Pycharm security plugin mentioned before.

**NEXT**: So this was about a user input displayed on client side
and now let's look at more dangerous server side unsanitized user input

## 8. Don't trust user input and sanitize it (SQLi)
- [№1 in OWASP Top 10 - Injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection)

- First attack [Feb 2002](https://www.securityfocus.com/news/346) (18 years ago)
- Recent one - [August 2020](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/freepik-data-breach-hackers-stole-83m-records-via-sql-injection/
), Freepick SQL injection 83 000 000 user records stolen

<img src={"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exploits_of_a_mom.png"} className="slide-bottom content-center large-picture" />

<!-- note

SQL injection.

Even though this attack is known for almost **20** years This is a number 1 in OWASP top 10,
most popular and most dangerous attack.

The threat is that user with malicious intent can provide a harmful input to the server,
and server will execute the code on the Database level.

On the slide is a classical comics about it.

**NEXT**: Ok, this is a scare and old attack vector, what can we do about it?

## 8. Don't trust user input and sanitize it (SQLi example)

```python
# Malicious SQL code, will return all rows from the
# db table regardless of initial filter in your SQL code
user_input = '"" or 1 = 1;--'

# BAD
# Note that we are formatting the string here, before passing it to Django
Customers.objects.raw(
    f'SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_name = {user_input}'
)

# BETTER
# Note that here we passing malicious output to the Django,
# rather than formatting the SQL code ourself.
# Postgres is smart enough to escape malicious input and not evaluate it.
Customers.objects.raw(
    'SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_name = %s',
    [user_input]
)
```

<!-- note
In the example code we see a dangerous user input, and how it can
be passed to Django.

In first case we format the string with user input and pass it to the database.
Database will execute this code because it does not know that it needs to do anything.
From the point of view of the database it is a perfectly valid string.

On the better example, we passing the code to the database but also
a user input as a separate parameter. That way Django and database layer know
that this is something that may contain dangerous code and won't evaluate the code
but rather escape the characters in the string.

## 8. Don't trust user input and sanitize it (SQLi prevention)

1. Use Django ORM
    ```python
    user_input = '"" or 1 = 1;--'
    Customers.objects.filter(customer_name=user_input)
    ```
1. If you can't - pass argumets instead of formatting the string
    ```python
    user_input = '"" or 1 = 1;--'
    Customers.objects.raw('SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_name = %s', [user_input])
    ```
1. Run automatic tools regularly to be notified about unprotected SQL formatiing

<!-- note

Best if you can use Django ORM, not only it makes code more readable,
but it also protects you from this kind of things out of the box. No extra step needed.

And if using Django ORM is not possible in some situations - for example
legacy code with huge 200 lines SQL statement that nobody understands anymore.

In this case it is totally fine to pass user input as paramethers,
that way it also will be sanitized and escaped by Django and the database.

**Next**: Brave yourself, 2 more steps and we are nearly at the end of the talk,
 going into I would say creative topics
