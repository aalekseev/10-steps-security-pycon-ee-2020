<!-- note

Well, there were a lot. On this slide you can see the major one of 2020, but a lot more
can be found from the link on the slide. The most recent one with 235 M user account exposed online
is terrifying. And you see, social media leaks data, banks leaks data, airports leaks data,
your local gym leaks data. Everyone do it.

I feel that security is a topic that needs to be reminded every now and then,
that's why I am here today to talk about security.

NEXT: Let's talk a bit about what is security and myths round it. It fells that there is a lot
misconceptions about this topic.
